**App Ideas**
App 1

The first app I would like to build is one that would serve as a marketplace for college campuses. The app would allow students from different colleges to sell anything, such as school books, furniture, clothes, and more, within their college community. This would not only provide a safety network but also make shipping easy. At the same time, the app would allow students to get money quickly and conveniently. The app would include features such as college email verification to ensure that only students from X college are in X marketplace group; posting items students want to sell with detailed descriptions of price, conditions, etc; messaging and connection to Instagram, allowing students to communicate and plan the selling/buying of items; a smart searching option that would show students items that are being sold based on a description provided.

App 2Â 

The second app I would like to build is similar to Forest but for users who mainly want to be productive without feeling isolated. This app would allow users to create or join small private virtual rooms where they can set timers, share their goals, and check in with one another before and after work/study sessions. Each small private group will include features such as progress updates where users can send other people in the group updates on their work (ex: studying for statistics, 30 minutes left); optional ambient sounds and connection to Spotify or Apple Music; group streak tracker to encourage consistency; locking out apps to remove distractions; ranking to compete against friends. 


## Notes

Other than taking some time to familiarize myself with the Xcode IDE, I did not encounter any major challenges while building this app.
